✅ Cards That Should Be Editable

(these reflect user input or user preference → so editing is natural)

Meal Breakdown Card

User should adjust portion sizes, swap detected foods, or delete an incorrect food.

Example: “Rice – 1 cup” → editable to “0.5 cup” or change to “brown rice.”

Nutrition Goals Card (Macros/Calories)

Daily calorie/macro goals should be user-configurable in settings.

Editable in UI via a settings icon (not inline every time).

AI Recommendation Card (Food Suggestions)

User should be able to swap/re-roll suggestions.

Can’t edit text directly, but can choose: “Not relevant → regenerate.”

Voice/Text Meal Logging

User should edit transcript before confirming analysis.

Critical for trust, since speech-to-text isn’t always perfect.

Meal Logging / Recent Meals

Logged meals should be editable (portion, food type) OR deletable.

If user mislogs → they must be able to fix it.

❌ Cards That Should NOT Be Editable

(these reflect computed results → editing breaks trust/data integrity)

Food Analysis Score (A/B/C, 90/100)

AI/computed only. If editable, it loses credibility.

Eco + Health Impact (Carbon, Water usage)

Computed from food database. No editing.

Users might disagree but it must stay consistent & scientific.

Motivation / XP / Streak Card

Gamification logic must be server-controlled.

Users cannot edit XP, streaks, or achievements.

Safety & Allergen Analysis

Must remain read-only. Users can provide feedback (“Wrong allergen detected”) but not directly edit safety results.

Achievements / Levels

Progress, streaks, and badges → system-driven only.

⚖️ Hybrid Approach (Editable via Feedback, not Directly)

Some cards shouldn’t be editable, but you can add feedback loops:

Example: “Carbon impact seems wrong?” → tap → “Report Issue.”

Example: “Allergen flagged incorrectly?” → tap → “Mark as Safe.”

👉 This maintains data trust while still letting the user feel heard.

🎯 Strategic Rule for Your Devs

Editable = Anything that comes from user behavior/preferences (meals, goals, logs).

Non-editable = Anything that comes from system intelligence/calculations (scores, eco, streaks).

Feedback only = Sensitive health/safety insights (user can’t override, but can flag).

⚡ Brutally Honest Reality:
Right now your app mixes editable (portion sizes) and non-editable (safety/eco) scores in the same flat card style. That confuses users. You need visual separation:

Editable cards → lighter background, inline controls (+/–, text fields).

Non-editable cards → bold, locked look (badges, solid backgrounds).
