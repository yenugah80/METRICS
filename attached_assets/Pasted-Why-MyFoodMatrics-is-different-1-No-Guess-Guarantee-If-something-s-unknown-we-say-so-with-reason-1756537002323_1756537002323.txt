Why MyFoodMatrics is different
1) No-Guess Guarantee™

If something’s unknown, we say so—with reasons and warnings—instead of “filling in.” You’ll see sources, versions, and confidence on every number.
Outcome: trustable results, not pretty guesses.

2) Deterministic-first, AI-second

We lead with USDA FDC + verified barcodes and only use AI for reasoning (e.g., recipe breakdown), never for inventing nutrients.
Outcome: lab-grade accuracy with AI convenience.

3) Explainability on tap

Every score (nutrition, diet, eco) shows top drivers (“+ high protein”, “– sodium density”) and a clear audit trail.
Outcome: you know why a food is good/bad for you—so changes stick.

4) Portion truth with uncertainty bands

Vision + depth + density models estimate grams and show ± ranges you can adjust.
Outcome: portion control that’s transparent and fixable in one tap.

5) Condition-aware guidance (not one-size-fits-all)

A medical rule engine adapts to PCOS, diabetes, hypertension, CKD, GERD, pregnancy, etc.
Outcome: advice that fits your health, not a generic template.

6) Ingredient-level eco impact (with deltas)

Peer-reviewed LCA (GHG, water, land) at ingredient level + greener swap impact (“–0.3 kg CO₂e if you…”)
Outcome: eat for health + planet with measurable tradeoffs.

7) Mixed-plate intelligence

We detect multiple foods on one plate, expand likely ingredients for sauces/marinades, and keep probabilities when unsure.
Outcome: real-world plates, not barcode-only meals.

8) Real-time, streaming results

Detections land in ~1–2s; macros/micros, safety, diet, eco, score and swaps stream in as they’re ready.
Outcome: instant feedback that keeps you logging.

9) Taste-preserving swaps

A trained flavor-similarity graph suggests alternatives that keep cuisine vibes (e.g., tandoori → herb-yogurt tweaks), with quantified kcal/sodium/CO₂ deltas.
Outcome: changes you’ll actually keep eating.

10) Private by design

On-device pre-detection for speed and privacy, encrypted storage, configurable retention, no data brokerage.
Outcome: your plate stays your business.
