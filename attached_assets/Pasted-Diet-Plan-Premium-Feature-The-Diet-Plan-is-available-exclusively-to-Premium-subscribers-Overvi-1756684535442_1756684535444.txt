Common Questions
How often should I update my diet plan?
We recommend updating your plan every 28 days, or whenever you experience significant changes in weight, health status, or goals.

Can I customize individual meals?
While you can't edit the suggested meals directly, each mealtime offers two options to choose from. You can also ask Monika, our nutritionist, for acceptable substitutions.

How does the Diet Plan work with my meal scanning?
Your scanned meals are compared against your diet plan targets, helping you see how your actual consumption aligns with your nutritional goals.

What if I have a specific dietary restriction?
The questionnaire includes a section for food restrictions and allergies, which the system will factor into your plan recommendations.
