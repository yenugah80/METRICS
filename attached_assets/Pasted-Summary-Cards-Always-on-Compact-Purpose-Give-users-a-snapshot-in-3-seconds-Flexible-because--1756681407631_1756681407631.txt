Summary Cards (Always-on / Compact)

Purpose: Give users a snapshot in 3 seconds.

Flexible because: They can hold high-level KPIs, then expand.

Example in your app:

“Meal Summary → 350 kcal | 18g protein | A Grade”

Tap to expand into details (ingredients, micros, eco impact).

Market proof: MyFitnessPal, Cronometer.

🔑 2. Expandable/Accordion Cards

Purpose: Keep things clean upfront but let data junkies go deeper.

Flexible because: You can add infinite detail (micros, eco data, confidence scores) without overwhelming.

Example:

Closed → “Safety: ✅ Safe”

Expanded → Recommendations + allergen details.

Market proof: Cronometer, Yazio.

🔑 3. Tabbed Cards

Purpose: Group related but separate contexts (Health, Eco, Motivation).

Flexible because: Tabs are scalable — you can add/remove without redesigning everything.

Example in your flow: Instead of three colored columns → one card with tabs:

Nutrition | Eco Impact | Safety | Motivation

Market proof: Fitbit dashboard, Lifesum.

🔑 4. Progress/Goal Cards (Rings + Bars)

Purpose: Visually satisfying way to show progress.

Flexible because: They work for calories, macros, hydration, streaks, XP, anything.

Example:

Macro ring (Protein/Carb/Fat).

Eco impact ring (Carbon saved vs avg).

Market proof: Apple Fitness, Duolingo XP.

🔑 5. Gamification Cards

Purpose: Motivate with achievements & streaks.

Flexible because: You can swap metrics (XP, streak, badges) without changing card format.

Example:

“🔥 Streak: 7 Days” card → expands into “Next badge at 10 days.”

Market proof: Duolingo, Yazio challenges.

🔑 6. Action Cards (Sticky CTA style)

Purpose: Guide user action (Save Meal, Edit Portions, Retry).

Flexible because: You can pin them to bottom or float above → keeps user flow tight.

Example:

One Save Meal (+XP) card pinned → always visible.

Market proof: Yazio “Save Meal,” Lifesum “Add Food.”

❌ What’s Not Flexible (in your current design)

Every insight in its own big colored block → rigid, overwhelming, doesn’t scale.

Mixing categories in one card (e.g., Motivation + Carbon + Water in the same block) → confusing.

Low-value raw data cards (like showing “0.9% confidence” upfront). → these belong hidden behind an expand.

💡 Brutally Honest Take

If you want flexibility + market readiness:

Make Summary Cards the anchor.

Use Expandable/Tabbed cards for detail.

Keep Progress/Gamification cards visually distinct but secondary.

One sticky action card at bottom for save/share/edit.

That way you can add/remove features (eco, allergens, streaks, etc.) without redesigning the whole page.
