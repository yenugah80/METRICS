Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs the **condensed PRD (Product Requirements Document)** I‚Äôve been building out with you for **MyFoodMatrics**. It‚Äôs everything from vision ‚Üí tech stack ‚Üí features ‚Üí data ‚Üí deployment. Think of this as your **single reference doc** for pitching, designing, and building.

# üìå PRD ‚Äî **MyFoodMatrics**

**Owner:** Harika (Solo Founder)
**Platform:** Web (Next.js) + Mobile (React Native/Expo)
**Backend:** Node.js (NestJS/Express) on AWS EC2 (t3.medium) + PostgreSQL (Docker ‚Üí RDS later)
**AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (NLP, coaching, recipes), Tesseract.js (OCR), STT (voice logging)
**Payments:** Stripe

---

## 1. Problem & Objective

* **Problem:** Current food apps stop at calories & macros. They require manual logging, ignore micronutrient gaps, and don‚Äôt flag allergens or sustainability.
* **Objective:** Make logging frictionless (photo/voice/text) and deliver **personalized, actionable insights**: missing micros, allergen flags, diet compatibility, sustainability, and daily coaching.

---

## 2. Target Audience

* Busy professionals who want quick photo/voice logging
* Diet followers (keto, vegan, gluten-free)
* People with allergies/sensitivities
* Eco-conscious users
* Free users with light needs ‚Üí convertable to Premium

---

## 3. Features & Functionality

### Free Tier

1. **Meal Logging** (Photo/Text)

   * OCR + NLP parsing into structured food items
   * Basic editing & save
2. **Nutrition Score** (0‚Äì100 + A‚ÄìD)

   * Based on macro balance, fiber, micros
3. **Diet Compatibility (Binary)**

   * Keto, Vegan, Gluten-free, etc.
4. **Recipes (5/day)**

   * Based on diets + cuisines
5. **Allergen Safety (Safe/Unsafe)**

   * Based on user allergen profile
6. **Daily Progress Score**

   * Aggregates meals, hydration, badges

### Premium (\$6.99/mo or \$83.88/yr)

1. **Voice Logging**
2. **Advanced Diet Compatibility** (% match + smart swaps)
3. **Unlimited Recipes** (+ mood filters, shopping list)
4. **Sustainability Score** (0‚Äì10 CO‚ÇÇ, water, local hints)
5. **Advanced Allergen Analysis** (severity, conditions)
6. **Personalized Wellness Tracking** (biometrics, mood-food links)

---

## 4. Nutrient Coverage

**MVP macros**: Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fat, Fiber
**MVP micros**: Iron, Vitamin C, Magnesium, Vitamin B12
**Premium micros (future)**: Zinc, Vitamin D, Folate, Calcium, Potassium, Sodium

---

## 5. Derived Scores

* **Nutrition Score**: composite of macros + fiber + micros
* **Diet Compatibility**: binary (Free), % + swaps (Premium)
* **Allergen Safety**: Safe/Unsafe (Free), severity (Premium)
* **Sustainability**: CO‚ÇÇ + water + sourcing (Premium)
* **Daily Wellness Score**: meals + hydration + frequency

---

## 6. System Architecture

**Frontend:**

* Web: Next.js + Tailwind
* Mobile: React Native (Expo)
* Shared: Design tokens, component library

**Backend:**

* NestJS (Node 20, TypeScript)
* PostgreSQL 15 (Docker on EC2, migrate ‚Üí RDS)
* Redis for caching/session/rate-limiting
* Nginx reverse proxy + PM2
* AI calls (OpenAI), OCR (Tesseract.js), Stripe billing

**Deployment:**

* AWS EC2 (t3.medium, Ubuntu 22.04)
* TLS via Certbot
* CI/CD via GitHub Actions
* Backups (pg\_dump ‚Üí local/S3)

---

## 7. Data Model (simplified)

* **users** (auth, premium flag)
* **profiles** (diet prefs, allergens, biometrics)
* **meals** (raw text, source, logged\_at, mood, hydration)
* **meal\_items** (name, qty, unit, confidence)
* **nutrition** (macros, micros totals per meal)
* **scores** (nutrition score, diet, allergen, sustainability)
* **recipes** (title, ingredients, steps, filters)
* **daily\_aggregates** (totals per day, wellness score)
* **payments** (stripe IDs, status)
* **events** (audit logs, analytics)

---

## 8. UX / UI Design Principles

* **Modern & minimal** (dark bg, green accent, rounded cards)
* **Frictionless logging** (photo first, editable AI parse)
* **Actionable scores** (dial, rings, chips)
* **Premium upsell** ‚Üí preview advanced features, blur gated parts, ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù CTA
* **Responsive** ‚Üí thumb-first mobile, adaptive desktop

---

## 9. Scoring Logic

* **Nutrition Score (0‚Äì100)**

  * Macros (50 pts), Fiber density (20 pts), Micros sufficiency (20 pts), Processed food penalty (‚àí10 to ‚àí20)
* **Diet**: Rule-based blocklists; Premium fuzzy % match + substitutions
* **Allergens**: Free = Safe/Unsafe; Premium = severity levels
* **Sustainability**: Food family heuristics (beef high, legumes low, etc.)

## 10. App Development Phases (full cycle)

1. **Research & Strategy**: problem, users, market gap
2. **Requirement Analysis**: features, nutrients, scores
3. **UX/UI Design**: tokens, wireframes, flows
4. **Prototyping**: Figma, React Native preview
5. **Backend Dev**: NestJS, DB, AI services, Stripe
6. **Frontend Dev**: Web & mobile UIs, API wiring
7. **Testing**: unit (scoring), integration (API), E2E (log‚Üíscore‚Üíinsight), perf (latency), a11y
8. **Deployment**: EC2 setup, Nginx, PM2, TLS, backups, CI/CD
9. **Launch**: seed recipes, test flows, marketing copy
10. **Maintenance**: bugfixes, DB migrations, feature releases

* **‚â•85% ingredient parse accuracy** (post-edit)
* **3+ logs/week per active user**
* **3% free‚Üípremium conversion**

Do you want me to also package this into a **clean PDF PRD** (with tables, diagrams, and scoring formulas) so you can share it with developers or investors?
