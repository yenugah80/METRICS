Review of the ChefAI Response to "I need you to make south indian lunch for me today":
The Good:
Immediate Suggestion: It immediately provides concrete South Indian lunch ideas (sambar with steamed rice, upma). This is a huge win compared to the previous endless questioning loop.
Enthusiastic Tone: "Ooh, South Indian lunch sounds delicious! How about..." maintains the friendly persona.
Brief Breakdown: It gives a quick, casual nutritional breakdown for sambar and coconut chutney. This aligns well with "Keep nutritional info to ONE casual sentence max" from the previous prompt, and "NO nutrition lectures or detailed breakdowns unless they specifically ask."
Follow-up Question: "How does that sound? I can give you a quick recipe for either or both! ☀️" This is a good, low-friction follow-up that offers to deepen the interaction.
Relevance: The suggestions are genuinely South Indian and suitable for lunch.
Areas for Improvement / What's Missing (for a full-fledged ChefAI):
Portion Control Specificity (Still Needs Work):
The prompt now says: "For portion control, suggest relative portion sizes (e.g., 'medium bowl', '1-2 idlis', 'small serving')."
The AI did provide "around 200-250 calories per serving" for sambar and "200 calories for a cup" for steamed rice, and "100 calories for a couple of tablespoons" for coconut chutney. This is good, but it's still missing the actual relative portion size guidance that was explicitly asked for in the user's previous overall request (the 10-day plan scenario, which also included "complete portion control") and in the refined prompt itself.
Fix: The prompt needs to enforce this more strictly for meal suggestions too, not just meal plans. The calories are great, but for a user who needs portion control, "a cup" for rice might still be too vague if they don't know what a healthy cup looks like or if they are prone to overserving. For instance, "a small cup (approx. 150g cooked)" would be more helpful.
Contextual Awareness from Previous Interactions (The Stomach Issues):
The user previously mentioned "facing health stomach issues." This response doesn't explicitly tie the suggestions back to being "easy on the stomach" or "gut-friendly." While sambar and upma can be gut-friendly (especially with less spice and well-cooked veggies), the AI didn't acknowledge this need.
Fix: The systemPrompt should strongly emphasize recalling and applying relevant user context (like "gut health focus") to all relevant suggestions, not just meal plans.
Ambiguity in "Quick Recipe":
The follow-up "I can give you a quick recipe for either or both!" is good. However, your ChefAiChatResponse has a recipeDetails object. The AI should be trained to know that when it offers a recipe, it should then output that structured recipeDetails object rather than just more free-form text.
Fix: This goes back to OpenAI Function Calling. You'd have a get_recipe(mealName) tool. When the user says "yes, recipe for sambar!", the AI calls the tool, and your backend provides the structured recipeDetails.
No recipeDetails or mealCards in the ChefAiChatResponse (as per JSON output):
Looking at your systemPrompt, the Respond in JSON example still explicitly sets "recipeDetails": null. This means even if the AI describes a recipe in its response field, it's not populating the structured recipeDetails object.
Fix: The JSON schema in the systemPrompt needs to be updated to allow for recipeDetails to be populated when a recipe is provided. This is how your front-end would parse it reliably. The AI needs to be instructed: "If you are describing a single meal or recipe, populate the recipeDetails field with its structured data."
Handling a Wider Range of Questions (Your Broader Goal):
You mentioned: "this is not only to meal plan i need the ai service inside my chat to respond to any of the questions related to food ingredients, meal, health, meal portion control, food related."
The current prompt is heavily geared towards "actionable content" like suggestions and plans. For more informational questions (e.g., "What's the best ingredient for gut health in South Indian food?", "How can I reduce carbs in my dosa?"), the AI needs:
A "Knowledge Retrieval" Mode: The prompt needs to allow the AI to switch to a more informational, explanatory mode when the user asks a knowledge-based question, rather than always trying to give a meal suggestion.
Tools for Database Lookup: For questions like "What did I eat yesterday?" or "Show me my nutrition trends," the AI should ideally call specific tools (get_recent_meals, get_daily_macros) to pull your user's data rather than trying to answer generically.
