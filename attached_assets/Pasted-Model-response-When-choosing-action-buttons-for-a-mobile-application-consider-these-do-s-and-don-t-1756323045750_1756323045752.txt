Model response
When choosing action buttons for a mobile application, consider these do's and don'ts to ensure a great user experience:
Do's:
Prioritize Clarity:
Do use clear, concise labels that immediately communicate the action. For example, "Save," "Delete," "Submit," "Add," or "Buy Now."
Do use familiar icons when appropriate, but always pair them with text if the icon's meaning isn't universally understood.
Maintain Consistency:
Do use a consistent visual style (color, shape, size, typography) for all action buttons throughout the app. This helps users recognize interactive elements.
Do place primary actions in consistent, expected locations (e.g., bottom bar, top right, or floating action button).
Visual Hierarchy:
Do differentiate primary actions from secondary and tertiary actions through visual weight. Primary buttons should be the most prominent (e.g., filled, bright color), while secondary buttons might be outlined or text-only.
Do limit the number of prominent actions on a single screen to avoid overwhelming the user.
Consider Finger-Friendliness:
Do ensure buttons are large enough to be easily tapped with a thumb or finger (minimum recommended size is typically 48x48 dp or 44x44 points).
Do provide sufficient padding around buttons to prevent accidental taps on adjacent elements.
Provide Feedback:
Do show a visual cue when a button is tapped (e.g., a ripple effect, a slight change in color, or a loading spinner). This confirms the tap was registered.
Do give feedback on the action's success or failure (e.g., a "Saved!" toast message, a confirmation screen).
Contextual Relevance:
Do make buttons appear when they are relevant. For example, a "Post" button should only be active once content has been entered.
Do disable buttons when their action cannot be performed, but explain why if it's not immediately obvious.
Test and Iterate:
Do user-test your button designs with real users to observe how they interact and if they understand the actions.
Do be prepared to iterate on your designs based on feedback.
