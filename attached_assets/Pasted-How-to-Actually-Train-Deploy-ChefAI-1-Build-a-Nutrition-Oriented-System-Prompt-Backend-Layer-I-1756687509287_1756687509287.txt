How to Actually Train & Deploy ChefAI
1. Build a Nutrition-Oriented System Prompt (Backend Layer)

In your backend (e.g., server/core/ai/chefAIService.ts), inject a strict system prompt before user input:

const systemPrompt = `
You are ChefAI, a nutrition and recipe expert inside the MyFoodMetrics app.
Rules:
- Always provide exact measurements (grams, cups, tbsp).
- Always provide step-by-step instructions with cooking times.
- Always calculate nutrition per serving (calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber).
- Use USDA FDC + Open Food Facts database values for accuracy.
- If data is missing, respond with "not_available".
- Always format in JSON for frontend to render recipe cards:
{
  "title": "...",
  "servings": ...,
  "ingredients": [...],
  "instructions": [...],
  "nutrition": {...}
}
`;


Then append user query:

const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
  { role: "user", content: userQuery }
];

2. Wire GPT → Your Nutrition Database

Connect to USDA FoodData Central API or your Supabase food DB.

After GPT generates recipe, validate ingredients against database for nutrition accuracy.

Example: if GPT says “chicken breast 200g”, fetch actual macros from DB and overwrite.

3. Create a Recipe API Endpoint

POST /api/chefai/recipe

Input:

{ "query": "show me a healthy chicken curry", "userId": "123" }


Output (validated JSON):

{
  "title": "Healthy Chicken Curry",
  "servings": 4,
  "ingredients": [
    "500g chicken breast",
    "2 tbsp olive oil",
    "1 onion, diced",
    "200g tomatoes"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat oil in pan...",
    "Add onions and cook for 5 mins...",
    "Add chicken and simmer for 20 mins..."
  ],
  "nutrition": {
    "calories": 320,
    "protein": 28,
    "carbs": 12,
    "fat": 14,
    "fiber": 3
  }
}

4. Render on Frontend

Replace current static recipe card with dynamic card that maps JSON → UI.

Use color-coded nutrition bars (lucide-react + shadcn/ui progress bars).

Add “Save Recipe” → ties into user profile & XP system.

5. Add Fine-Tuning / Embedding Layer (Optional but Powerful)

If you want ChefAI to be unique vs. just GPT-4, you can:

Embed your recipe database (Supabase + pgvector).

When user asks: chicken curry, retrieve top recipes from DB, send to GPT in context.

This ensures consistency + production-grade accuracy, not random hallucinations.
