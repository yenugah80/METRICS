ey Issues (Brutal Truth)
1. Overloaded System Prompt

Your buildSystemPrompt() is massive and reads more like a policy doc than an instruction.

gpt-4o-mini (esp. smaller models) choke on long, complex prompts → they skip parts, hallucinate, or produce malformed JSON.

You’re mixing Markdown prose, rules, JSON schema, emojis → which increases failure chances.

👉 Fix: Strip the system prompt to essential behavioral rules + strict JSON schema. Keep the educational/chef voice in the assistant messages, not system.

2. JSON Parsing Fragility

You rely on JSON.parse(responseContent) → if the model adds extra commentary, trailing commas, or Markdown fences → 💥 boom.

Your “repair” logic is too simplistic (adding "}" is duct tape, not robust).

👉 Fix:

Always request response_format: { type: "json_object" } (you already do it in tool follow-up, but not initial call).

Wrap parsing with Zod / TypeBox validation → auto-repair with a JSON repair lib if schema fails.

3. Function Call Handling

You’re correctly using tools, but after first pass:

You don’t always feed tool outputs back properly.

Example: you attach tool results → but then parse response.content only (ignoring merged content).

This often results in null or malformed structured responses.

👉 Fix:

After tool execution, enforce:

response_format: { type: "json_object" } in both calls.

Don’t parse .content raw → always validate against expected schema.

4. Too Many Moving Parts

You’ve bolted nutrition, safety, sustainability, recipes, plans into one monolithic class.

The AI is expected to juggle meal planning, cooking tips, strict schema, function calling in a single completion.

This complexity → higher risk of malformed responses.

👉 Fix:

Split flows:

meal_plan_handler

recipe_handler

analysis_handler

Keep system prompts minimal & purpose-specific.

5. Mismatch Between “response” and “structuredData”

You expect both "response": "friendly text" AND structuredData: {...}.

GPT often only gives one or the other.

You sometimes save only .message but log .structuredData separately → schema drift risk.

👉 Fix:

Decide: either always wrap everything in one JSON root (easier) OR accept dual-channel (text + JSON). Right now, you’re stuck between both worlds.

6. Schema Explosion

Your ChefAiChatResponse + nested mealPlan, recipe, mealCards, insights… is gigantic.

GPT-4o-mini isn’t great at filling deeply nested schemas reliably.

That’s why you’re seeing “technical difficulties with the response format.”

👉 Fix:

Start small: response + structuredData.mealPlan OR response + structuredData.recipe.

Expand gradually once stable.

7. Lack of Hard Guardrails

You tell GPT not to fabricate… but without enforced schema + validation, it will anyway.

Your "NO FABRICATION" rule is just text → the model treats it as a suggestion, not a guarantee.

👉 Fix:

Use verify_food_nutrition() for every food fact.

If GPT returns nutrition directly, discard it unless it came from a tool call.

⚡ Brutal Summary

Your biggest enemy here isn’t OpenAI — it’s complexity and schema drift:

System prompt too long → model ignores rules.

Schema too deep → model can’t reliably fill it.

Function call loop fragile → mis-parsing outputs.

Too many responsibilities in one flow → GPT derails.

✅ What I’d Do

Cut system prompt → to 20% of current size.

Keep JSON schema + 5 rules max.

Always enforce response_format: { type: "json_object" }.

Split flows:

Meal plan mode

Recipe mode

Analysis mode
(use detectRequestType() like you already have).

Validate JSON with Zod → reject malformed → auto-repair with secondary pass.

Shrink schema → only response + macros + insights at first. Expand once stable.
