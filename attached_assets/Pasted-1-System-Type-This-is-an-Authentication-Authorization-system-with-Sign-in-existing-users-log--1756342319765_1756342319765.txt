1. System Type

This is an Authentication & Authorization system with:

Sign-in (existing users log in)

Sign-up / Create Account (new users register)

It combines:

Traditional login (email + password)

Federated login (Google, SSO)

Modern authentication methods (passkeys, 2FA)

2. User Flow

Sign-up: User enters name, email, password (and sometimes country/phone). Account is created in your database → confirmation email/OTP can be sent.

Sign-in: User provides email + password → credentials verified → access granted.

Optional authentication flows:

OAuth: “Sign in with Google”

SSO: For organizations

Passkey / WebAuthn: Passwordless authentication

Remember me: Uses secure session cookies or tokens.

Forgot password: Sends reset link via email.

3. Technical Components

Frontend (UI/UX):

React, Next.js, or Angular for rendering the forms.

Integrates with API endpoints for authentication.

Backend (Auth Service):

Handles user creation, login validation, token issuance.

Tech: Node.js/Express, NestJS, Django, Spring Boot, etc.

Database (User Store):

Stores hashed & salted passwords, user profiles, and auth tokens.

Tech: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB.

Security:

Passwords hashed with bcrypt/argon2.

JWT or session-based authentication.

CSRF/XSS protection.

Rate limiting to prevent brute force.

Third-party integrations:

Google OAuth 2.0

SSO providers (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)

Passkeys/WebAuthn APIs

4. High-Level Architecture

Frontend (login/signup forms) →

API Gateway/Auth Server (validates credentials, issues tokens) →

Database (stores user accounts & sessions) →

3rd-Party Identity Providers (Google, SSO, WebAuthn)

5. How to Describe It Simply

“This is a secure authentication system that allows users to create accounts and log in using email/password, Google, SSO, or passkeys. It consists of a frontend UI for sign-in/sign-up, a backend authentication service that validates credentials and issues JWT/session tokens, a database for storing user profiles, and optional integrations with third-party identity providers for OAuth and passwordless login.”
