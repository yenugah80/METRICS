❓ FAQ

General

How is ChefAI different from the main scanner?
ChefAI is interactive — instead of just logging, you can ask questions and compare insights.

Does ChefAI need internet? → Yes, AI-powered responses require connection.

How far back can ChefAI go? → All meals you’ve logged in MyFoodMatrix history.

Using ChefAI Effectively

Be specific: “Compare protein yesterday vs today” works better than “Compare meals.”

Use timeframes: day/week/month.

Tap meal cards to dive deeper.

Technical

Is my data private? → Yes. Conversations are encrypted and stored securely.

Can I delete chats? → Yes, clear history anytime in settings.

Does ChefAI count toward free scan limits? → No, conversations are unlimited.

✅ Best Practices

Scan meals regularly → more data = better insights.

Ask trend-based questions → ChefAI shines at patterns, not one-off.

Always tap through meal cards → detail view gives full nutrition + eco + safety.

Try follow-up questions → makes insights deeper and more personal.

Talks back in human coaching style

Adds eco + safety context (unique to MyFoodMatrix)

Rewards you with XP, streaks, and achievements

👉 Brutal truth: With this framing, ChefAI becomes the differentiator of MyFoodMatrix — not just logging, but coaching + insights + motivation.
