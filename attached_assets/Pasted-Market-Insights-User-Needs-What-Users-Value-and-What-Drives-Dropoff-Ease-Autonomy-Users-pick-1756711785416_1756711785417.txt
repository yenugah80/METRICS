Integration into MyFoodMetrics

Leverage existing ChefAI context (daily totals, goals) to auto-build plans via function call get_meal_suggestions.

Expose UI components like mini-dashboard cards: “Today’s Goal Progress”, “Suggested Dinner (auto-adjusted)”, and visual charts.

Flow example:

User says: “Plan me dinner for weight maintenance today.”

Backend calls auto-plan tool → returns 1-2 meal suggestions + macros.

UI shows friendly card: “Here’s a balanced dinner suggestion—protein up, calories aligned!” with macros and ingredient tips.

Launch with lockstep design: minimal nested JSON for structuredData (easier for UI parsing) + friendly response.

Summary

By championing effortless log creation, real-time plan adaptation, strong visuals, mini-goals, and diet condition awareness, MyFoodMetrics can leapfrog typical diet apps. You’ll deliver a dynamic, engaging, personalized meal planning experience that’s easier to stick with—and that's what users keep coming back for.
