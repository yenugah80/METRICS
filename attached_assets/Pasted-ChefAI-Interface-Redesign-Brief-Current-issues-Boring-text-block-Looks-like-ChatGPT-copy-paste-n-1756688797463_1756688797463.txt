ChefAI Interface Redesign Brief
Current issues

Boring text block → Looks like ChatGPT copy-paste, no visual hierarchy.

No nutrition context styling → Protein numbers, food items, and suggestions don’t stand out.

Poor use of space → The chat layout is too basic, doesn’t feel like a nutrition assistant.

Action buttons (blue links) → Look generic, not like interactive smart suggestions.

No personality → ChefAI should feel like a nutrition coach, not just a chatbot.

Redesign Goals

ChefAI should feel like a smart nutrition assistant dashboard inside chat, not plain text. Think of Notion AI + MyFitnessPal insights cards.

UX Improvements to Implement
1. Response Cards

Break AI responses into cards/sections, not one block.

Example:

🍗 Protein Sources → list in a styled card.

🥗 Plant-Based Options → separate card.

⚡ Smart Tip → highlighted with background.

2. Highlight Key Data

Numbers like 31g protein or 100g salmon should be bold & color-coded (green for good, red for warning).

Use icons for macros:

🔴 Calories

🟢 Protein

🟡 Carbs

🔵 Fat

3. Interactive Suggestions

Replace blue text links with pill-shaped suggestion buttons (shadows, rounded corners).

Example:
🔘 Show me a high-protein recipe
🔘 Suggest vegetarian swaps

4. Recipe Card Inline

If AI suggests a recipe, display it as a mini card:

📸 Dish image (placeholder if none)

Ingredients

Nutrition per serving

5. Coach Personality

Add a small ChefAI avatar/icon before messages.

Use friendly tone headers:

“Here’s how to boost your protein 👇”

“Smart swaps you can try today 🌱”

6. Quick Action Shortcuts

Above input box, add quick prompts:

🍳 Recipes

🥗 Meal Plans

Example Layout
[ ChefAI Avatar ]  "Here’s how you can increase your protein intake 👇"

🍗 Lean Protein Sources
- Chicken breast (31g/100g)
- Turkey (29g/100g)
- Beef (26g/100g)

🥗 Plant-Based Options
- Lentils (9g/100g)
- Chickpeas (8g/100g)
- Tofu (10g/100g)

⚡ Smart Tip
“Pair beans + rice for complete protein!”

[ Suggestion Buttons ]
🔘 Show protein-rich recipes
🔘 Suggest vegetarian alternatives

Tech Implementation Notes (tell your dev)

Use Card components (shadcn/ui, Material UI, or Tailwind with shadow-md, rounded-2xl).

Highlight macros with progress bars or colored badges.

Store AI response as structured JSON → render UI cards, not raw text.

Example AI response:

{
  "sections": [
    {"title":"Lean Proteins","items":[{"name":"Chicken","protein":"31g/100g"}]},
    {"title":"Plant Proteins","items":[{"name":"Lentils","protein":"9g/100g"}]},
    {"tip":"Pair beans + rice for complete protein!"}
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Show me high-protein recipes",
    "Suggest vegetarian swaps"
  ]
}


👉 This way, your dev won’t just render text but structured cards that look beautiful.
