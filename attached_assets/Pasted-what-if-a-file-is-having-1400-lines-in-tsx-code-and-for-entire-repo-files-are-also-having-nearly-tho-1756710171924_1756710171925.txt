what if a file is having 1400 lines in tsx code and for entire repo files are also having nearly those many lines
A codebase with many 1400-line TSX files, especially within a monorepo, indicates a high risk of poor maintainability, reduced performance, and slow development. This is a common form of "technical debt" that, while functional for a time, will cause increasing problems as the project grows. 
The core problems of large files
Low modularity: Large, monolithic files often mean components and functions are tightly coupled, making them difficult to reuse or test in isolation.
Reduced performance: In large monorepos, massive files can lead to slower build times for the entire project, even if only a small part changes. The TypeScript compiler and bundlers can struggle with overly large files and complex types.
Poor readability and maintenance: It's difficult for developers to reason about or debug a single component with 1400 lines of code. The large surface area makes it hard to pinpoint bugs or make changes without introducing regressions.
Developer friction: Large pull requests with many changes in a single file are difficult to review. Merging is also more likely to cause conflicts, leading to wasted time and effort. 
A phased approach to refactoring
Addressing this issue requires a strategic, step-by-step refactoring plan rather than a complete rewrite.
Phase 1: Preparation
Introduce and enforce tooling: Add tools to your codebase to prevent the problem from getting worse.
Set up a linter like ESLint with a max-lines rule to start catching excessively large files and enforce limits for new code.
Integrate Prettier to automatically format code and maintain consistency across the codebase.
Define a clear directory structure: Create a logical, feature-based directory structure to house the smaller files you will extract.
Prioritize the worst offenders: Use tooling to identify the largest and most complex files first. Consider files with the highest number of imports, state variables, or complex logic as good candidates for the initial refactoring. 
Phase 2: Refactoring one file at a time
Extract pure components and JSX: If your 1400-line TSX file contains a large render method, break out smaller, presentational JSX fragments into their own "dumb" components. These components should receive data and callbacks via props.
Extract logic into custom hooks: Identify state management, side effects (like data fetching), and other complex logic and move them into reusable custom hooks. This is a crucial step for making large React components more manageable.
Separate utility functions and constants: Move any reusable helper functions, constants, or types that aren't specific to a single component into a separate utils/ directory.
Isolate data models and types: Define shared TypeScript interfaces and types in a central location, separate from your components. This improves consistency and makes it easier to track complex data structures.
Rename and commit in small steps: To make reviews easier, perform the refactoring in small, self-contained commits. Name the new files clearly and update all necessary imports. Your IDE can help automate this process. 
Phase 3: Scaling within a monorepo
Implement workspaces: If you are not already using them, set up workspaces in your package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm). This lets you manage multiple packages within a single repository, making it easier to manage dependencies.
Use TypeScript project references: For large TypeScript monorepos, use project references to break up your codebase into smaller, interdependent units. This can significantly reduce build times.
Optimize CI/CD: Configure your CI/CD pipelines to use path filters to build and test only the code that has changed. This prevents the entire monorepo from being rebuilt and tested on every commit. 
Long-term strategies
Code ownership and review: Establish clear ownership of different parts of the codebase and ensure all changes, especially to critical files, go through a thorough review process.
Encourage small, atomic commits: Over time, train the team to favor small, focused changes and pull requests over large, multi-purpose ones.
Document and knowledge-share: Documenting why the codebase was refactored and the new best practices is essential. Holding knowledge-sharing sessions will help new developers understand the new architecture.

what is this issue called
The issue of having excessively large files in a codebase is referred to by several terms, all of which fall under the umbrella of poor codebase health and technical debt. The most direct and commonly used term is code smell. 
Common terms for this issue
Code Smells
This is a general term for any symptom in source code that indicates a deeper problem. Large files are a prime example. The specific category of code smell for large files is called a Bloater. 
Bloaters: This describes code that has "bloated" to such a size that it becomes difficult to work with, maintain, and understand. It can apply to large classes, long methods, or entire files. 
Monolithic Components
In the context of components (like TSX files), a file with 1400 lines is often described as a monolithic component. 
Monolithic component: This term implies that a single component is handling too many responsibilities, violating the principle of single responsibility. This leads to tight coupling, making it difficult to change one part of the component without affecting others. 
God Objects
For files that contain a large class or object with an excessive number of responsibilities, the term God object is often used. 
God object: This describes an object that knows or does too much, serving as a central hub for logic that should be distributed among many smaller, specialized objects. 
Summary of terms
Term 	Specificity	Example Scenario
Code Smell	General	A symptom of a deeper problem; covers all other related terms.
Bloater	Specific	A general term for code that has become excessively large.
Monolithic Component	Specific	A large, single component (often in a UI framework) that lacks modularity.
God Object	Specific	A file with a class or object that has far too many responsibilities.
