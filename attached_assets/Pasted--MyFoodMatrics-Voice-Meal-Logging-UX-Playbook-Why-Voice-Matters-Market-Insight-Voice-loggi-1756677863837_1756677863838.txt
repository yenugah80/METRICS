🎙 MyFoodMatrics — Voice Meal Logging UX Playbook
🌍 Why Voice Matters (Market Insight)

Voice logging increases adoption + retention (1.7× more food entries, 1.5× more active days vs text logging)【pmc†source】.

Typing = tedious → users don’t log consistently.

Voice = frictionless → feels natural, quick, and personal.

Apps like Alma, FoodBuddy, SpeakMeal already lean on voice as their hero feature, not an add-on.

👉 Brutal Truth: If you only “add” voice, users will ignore it. If you integrate voice seamlessly into Scan + Feedback + Analysis, they’ll adopt it.

🧑‍💻 Core User Needs

✅ Control — “Show me what the app heard, let me confirm or edit.”
✅ Clarity — “Summarize what I ate in plain language, don’t drown me in numbers first.”
✅ Speed — “Make logging → feedback happen instantly.”
✅ Optional Speak-back — “Let me click 🔊 if I want to hear it, don’t force sound.”
✅ Privacy Transparency — “Where does my voice go?”

🎯 User Flow (Exact)

Entry → User goes to Scan tab → chooses Voice.

Recording State → “Start Recording” (purple) → “Stop Recording” (red).

“Logging by typing is tedious—I just talk and the app does the math. That ease makes me log consistently.” (Reddit user)

“I love seeing the transcript before saving—sometimes voice hears me wrong, and I want to fix it.”

“Don’t force sound on me—let me click to hear it.”

🚀 Key Differentiators (Make Users Love It)

Trust Layer → Always show transcript first.

Efficiency Layer → Fast backend analysis (<3s ideal).

Choice Layer → Speak-back only on 🔊 click.

Gamification Layer → XP/streaks for daily logs (especially voice logs).

Transparency Layer → Small “🔒 We don’t store your raw voice” disclaimer.

🛑 Brutal Checklist

❌ Don’t keep a dead “Voice Tab” (confuses users).

❌ Don’t pre-fill transcripts with fake text.

❌ Don’t auto-play voice results.

✅ Confirm transcript before analyze.

✅ Allow edit/re-record.

✅ Always show both macros + micros + suggestions.

📌 Summary Statement for Stakeholders

“Voice logging must live inside Scan, not as a separate tab. It should give users control (confirm transcript), clarity (clear summary), and choice (optional speak-back). Done right, it drives adoption and retention, turning meal logging from a chore into a natural conversation.”
